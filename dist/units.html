A "civilization" means a society with large permanent settlements featuring urban development, social satisfaction, specialization of labor, centralized organization, and written or other formal means of communication. A river gives the inhabitants a reliable source of water for drinking and agriculture. Additional benefits include fishing, fertile soil due to annual flooding, and ease of transportation. The first great civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia and Egypt, all grew up in river valleys.</p> <p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gshjy4g8TC5AmwxU_0xrJVBhJg4oj_y_C1GJ4YTVRos/edit?usp=sharing" class="class-notes" target="_blank">River Valley Civilizations Notes</a> </p> <p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WWFRspsbymQT9r-Jkc9uxVxgMCoOKXES/view?usp=sharing" class="class-notes" target="_blank">River Valley Civilization Readings</a> </p> </div> <div id="rvMap" class="map"></div> </div>  <div class="card"> <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo"> <h2 class="mb-0"> <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo"> Unit 2: Classical Civilizations (500 BCE - 900 CE) <i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i> </button> </h2> </div> </div> <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#headingTwo"> <div class="card-body"> <p>Classical civilizations in Eurasia employed a variety of methods to expand and maintain control over vast territories.

The first of these was the Maya civilization.</p> <p>About 2,800 years ago, people known as the Maya lived in farming villages on the Yucatan Peninsula and the highlands to the south. From about A.D. 250 to A.D. 900, they built city-states in Central America that included great pyramid temples and public plazas featuring huge stone columns that recounted their history. Excavations at Tikal, Guatemala, one of the greatest and oldest Maya centers, have revealed thousands of structures and artifacts. The findings include temples, pyramids, ball-playing courts, stone monuments, tools, ceremonial objects, and a great many pottery fragments.</p> <p>The Inca began settling in the Valley of Cuzco in the Andes Mountains of central Peru around the year 1200. Between 1440 and 1500, they expanded their empire until it extended nearly 2,500 miles from north to south and included as many as 16 million people. The lands they occupied included mountains, coastal desert, and low-lying jungle.</p> <p>The center of the Aztec civilization was in the Valley of Mexico, a huge high-elevation basin in the Sierra Madre Mountains. This valley had a mild climate that was good for agriculture. The surrounding lowlands offered a hotter, wetter tropical climate and an abundance of natural resources.</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ilu7KQkwngC6Xh8ZXg5KNWLGxvt8pbRN" class="class-notes" target="_blank">Americas Notes</a></p> </div> <div id="americasMap" class="map"></div> </div>  <div class="card"> <div class="card-header" id="headingFour"> <h2 class="mb-0"> <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour"> Unit 4: Post-Classical Civilizations (476 - 1500 CE) <i class="fas fa-globe-asia"></i> </button> </h2> </div> </div> <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-parent="#headingFour"> <div class="card-body"> <p>Post-classical history runs from about 476 CE to 1500 CE.

East Asia experienced the full establishment of power of Imperial China. Religions such as Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism spread in the region. Gunpowder was developed in China during the post-classical era. The Mongol Empire connected Europe and Asia, creating safe trade and stability between the two regions.

The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.</p> <div id="renMap" class="map"></div> <h2><em>Reformation</em></h2> <p>The Reformation (alternatively named the Protestant Reformation or the European Reformation) was a movement within Western Christianity in 16th-century Europe that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church and papal authority in particular. Although the Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517, there was no schism between the Catholic Church and the nascent Luther until the 1521 Edict of Worms. The edict condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas.</p> <div id="refMap" class="map"></div> <h2><em>Age of Exploration</em></h2> <p>The Age of Exploration, is an informal and loosely defined term for the period in European history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in European culture and which was the beginning of globalization. It also marks the rise of the widespread adoption of colonialism and mercantilism as national policies in Europe. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents.</p> <div id="expMap" class="map"></div> </div> </div> </div>  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-J6qa4849blE2+poT4WnyKhv5vZF5SrPo0iEjwBvKU7imGFAV0wwj1yYfoRSJoZ+n" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>  <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>  <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>  <script type="text/javascript" src="/units.05ee1961.js"></script>  </body></html>
