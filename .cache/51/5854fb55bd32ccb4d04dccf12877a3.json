From about A.D. 250 to A.D. 900, they built city-states in Central America that included great pyramid temples and public plazas featuring huge stone columns that recounted their history. Excavations at Tikal, Guatemala, one of the greatest and oldest Maya centers, have revealed thousands of structures and artifacts. The findings include temples, pyramids, ball-playing courts, stone monuments, tools, ceremonial objects, and a great many pottery fragments.</p>\n        <p>The Inca began settling in the Valley of Cuzco in the Andes Mountains of central Peru around the year 1200. Between 1440 and 1500, they expanded their empire until it extended nearly 2,500 miles from north to south and included as many as 16 million people. The lands they occupied included mountains, coastal desert, and low-lying jungle.</p>\n        <p>The center of the Aztec civilization was in the Valley of Mexico, a huge high-elevation basin in the Sierra Madre Mountains. This valley had a mild climate that was good for agriculture.

Although the Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517, there was no schism between the Catholic Church and the nascent Luther until the 1521 Edict of Worms.

It also marks the rise of the widespread adoption of colonialism and mercantilism as national policies in Europe. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents.</p>\n        <div id=\"expMap\" class=\"map\"></div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n    <!-- JQuery CDN -->\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-J6qa4849blE2+poT4WnyKhv5vZF5SrPo0iEjwBvKU7imGFAV0wwj1yYfoRSJoZ+n\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    <!-- Axios CDN-->\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js\"></script>\n    <!-- JS used for Bootstrap -->\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    <!-- Bootstrap CDN -->\n    <script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    <!-- my JS file -->\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/dca08a3aabedc40a0e2b440d49d9baac.js\"></script>\n    <!-- Init Google Maps Script -->\n  </body>\n\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"0c7a1e3ea90a24d53fed7167d5fb3f06","cacheData":{}}
